This in turn, looked at the following:
- Does gender influence the content, or score of posted reviews?
Sentiment is where there was a marked difference between the scores and the sentiment expressed in the reviews. These were inconsistent, both positively and negatively e.g. negative sentiment vs stars

Predicting reviews and scores is an uphill task. There is often little consistency between the scores and reviews and what one reviewer scores against a review may be completely different to another reviewer with a near identical review. Seasonal and gender variations do not provide much help. There is also some evidence that reviewers may be influenced by previous reviews too. Availability of better demographic data would certainly help. Despite the deficiencies, many consumers make use of sites like Yelp before making a purchase, or otherwise spending money, as do businesses looking to improve their customer experiences and ultimately turnover. However, a more objective approach is what is desirable.
